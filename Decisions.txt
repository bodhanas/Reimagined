There was a wealthy gentleman who lived in a stately château in France with his beautiful wife and little daughter, Ella. They had lived happily until Ella's mother suddenly fell vastly ill. Her father scouted far over the land, bringing his cherished wife to each and every reputable doctor that he could find, only to no avail. When Ella's mother felt her end drawing near, she summoned her beloved daughter to her bedside and spoke her last words, "Dear child, remain pious and good, and then our dear God will always protect you, and I will look down on you from heaven and be near you." With this, she allowed her eyes to flutter shut as she slipped into a deep, eternal slumber. Ella kept these words close to her heart as she visited her mother's grave each day and wept, remaining pious and good. Days slowly became months which gradually became years as Ella grew older, beginning to resemble the beauty and kindness of her mother. By the time she had turned sixteen, Ella's father had taken himself another wife, Lady Treimane. Not unlike Ella's late mother, Lady Treimane was a gorgeous woman with lustrous locks that cascaded to her waist like a waterfall. However, her entrancing exterior concealed a much darker heart within. With her, Lady Tremaine brought her two stunning, yet selfish and spoiled daughters from her previous marriage. They were fraternal twins, the same age as Ella. Drizella was the older one, by exactly thirteen minutes. Her hair matched the colour of coffee like her mother's whereas Anastasia's matched the auburn ringlets of her late father's. One day, it happened that Ella's father would be traveling to the fair. "Would you girls like anything?" he asked. "Beautiful dresses!" demanded Drizella. "Pearls and jewels!" cried Anastasia. "And what about you, dear Ella?" her father turned to her. What should Ella ask for?

And so, Ella's father purchased the most beautiful dresses he could find for Drizella, and a chest of pearls and jewels each for Ella and Anastasia. "My, what beautiful dresses!" marvelled Drizella. "Oh, how these pearls and jewels sparkle!" gasped Ella and Anastasia. "But why should that stupid goose get to own some of her own?" Anastasia retorted. "All of these pearls and jewels should belong to me!" And just like that, Ella never saw her chest of pearls and jewels ever again. But Ella's pain was far from over. A year had flown by since her stepmother and stepsisters moved into the château, and Ella had now turned seventeen. But with her father's sudden and dubious death, she had not felt up for celebration. Her birthday party had become another funeral instead. Ella's remaining family had not been comforting in the slightest. With her father now gone from the picture, Lady Tremaine and her daughters were relentless with their malevolence towards Ella. "Why shall you sit in the parlour with us?" they scowled. "If you desire bread to eat, then you must earn it! Out with this kitchen maid!" From there, they robbed Ella of her elegant clothing and replaced them all with old, torn rags sheathed in filth. The Tremaines forced her to slave away at the housework every day, from dawn to dusk. She was tasked with all the cooking, cleaning, gardening, carrying the water, preparing the fires, sewing and stitching with not an ounce of help. However, her stepsisters were not content just yet. They relished in making her life as hard as they could, doing everything imaginable to hurt her. They made fun of her, called her nasty names, forced her to pamper them, and scattered lentils into the ashes for her so that she had to painstakingly pick each of them out by hand again on her own. They stripped her of her comforts, ridding Ella of her bed so that she had to sleep on the hearth by the ashes. And because she was always covered in cinders, they nicknamed her "Cinderella." "Cinderella! Lucifer smells almost as filthy as you, bathe him at once!" Lady Tremaine ordered. Ella made eye contact with the black cat curled up on the sofa. He hissed at her. What should Ella do?

+10 EXP! And so, Ella's father purchased the most beautiful dresses he could find for Drizella, and a chest of pearls and jewels for Anastasia. On his way back home from the fair, Ella's father passed by a beautiful hazel tree. A twig sprouting from it met his hat and brushed it aside until it was gently pushed off. "My Ella had asked for this, had she not?" he asked himself. He placed a light hold on the twig and gently snapped it off before continuing on his way home. "My, what beautiful dresses!" marvelled Drizella. "Oh, how these pearls and jewels sparkle!" gasped Anastasia. "Thank you, Papa…" Ella ran to her mother's grave, twig firmly in hand. She planted it before her mother's tombstone and wept. She wept, and wept, and wept. She continued to weep so much that her tears began to water the twig. And as if by magic, it had blossomed into a beautiful hazel tree by the very next day! But Ella's pain was far from over. A year had flown by since her stepmother and stepsisters moved into the château, and Ella had now turned seventeen. But with her father's sudden and dubious death, she had not felt up for celebration. Her birthday party had become another funeral instead.

+10 EXP! And so, with great difficulty, Ella did as she was told. She remained good like her late mother told her to and bathed Lucifer the Cat in the gardens despite his relentless scratching, hissing and yowling. Ella managed to get quite clean as well in the process! Two years had passed the same and Ella and her stepsisters were now nineteen. A knock on the door summoned Ella to whom she found belonged to a messenger from the King! He explained that all the young women in the land were invited to a royal ball at the palace, so that the prince could select a bride for himself! Ella, hearing this, grew ecstatic and rushed inside to inform her stepmother of the good news. Lady Tremaine was overjoyed. "May I please attend the royal ball too?" Ella asked politely. A moment of silence passed before Lady Tremaine blinked and burst into an unstoppable fit of laughter. "You, Cinderella? You, all covered with dust and dirt, and you want to go to the ball? You have neither clothes nor shoes, and yet you want to dance!" However, Ella persisted to beg and Lady Tremaine finally said, "Very well. I may let you if you help your darling stepsisters get ready first." And so, Ella brushed each of her stepsister's hair until not a tangle could be found. And polished at their shoes until they sparkled. "They are ready!" Ella announced excitedly, hoping she would now be allowed to attend the ball. "Already?" Lady Tremaine asked in surprise. She thought to herself for a moment before speaking again. "But alas, the château remains to be a mess. Who would be cleaning it up if you were to go to the ball?" What should Ella do?
Do her chores by herself

"What did you just say to me?" Lady Tremaine stated more than asked, each word dripping with venom. "I have been nothing but generous with you, keeping you fed and letting you stay in this spacious château without paying rent when it's not my obligation to do so!" "You are not my daughter, and yet you have the nerve to behave this way with me when all I asked for is a simple favour?" "Ungrateful brat." And just like that, Lady Tremaine yanked Ella by her soiled sleeve and locked her in the attic for eternity, never to return despite Ella's pleas for forgiveness. Slowly, but surely, Ella fell into a deep starvation that was never to be fulfilled ever again. THE END.

+10 EXP! Hooray! Ella finished all her chores in time! To make matters even better, Ella's animal friends surprised her with a beautiful pink gown they made for her from old scraps of fabric, beads and ribbons lying around! "Oh, thank you so much my dear friends!" she cried. "Now I'll be able to go to the ball!" She couldn't be more wrong. "Hey! Those are my ribbons!" Drizella snapped, yanking Ella's dress and tearing the ribbons off. "And those are my beads!" Anastasia cried. "Pull those off too!" "Now, now, Anastasia dear," Lady Tremaine began. For a bare moment, Ella had a slither of hope that her stepmother would defend her. But just like her stepsisters had always called her, what a stupid goose Ella was! "You can take a turn after your older sister!" Lady Tremaine cackled. And so they ripped and pulled until Ella's pink gown became no different from the other old rags that she always wore. The Tremaine family giggled one last time before leaving the château and slamming the door behind them. What on earth was Ella going to do?

Ella fails to finish her chores in time and is stuck cleaning for the rest of the night. Unfortunately, since Ella was unable to reach the royal ball before it ended, it was instead Drizella who captured the eye of Prince Charming. He was instantly enamoured by her beauty, and much like Ella's father, was fooled by good looks rather than appreciating good heart and fell for the wrong woman. They danced the entire night which ultimately led to his sudden proposal. Drizella accepted and they got married, living happily ever after. THE END.

You are aware that this is Ella's story, right? It couldn't be possible that you're confusing Ella with Elsa, could it? That would be ridiculous. Well, since this is Ella we're talking about, obviously spending a long time walking in the night with nothing on but a ripped gown would cause any ordinary human to undergo hypothermia. So, undergo hypothermia Ella went. THE END.

Ella ran away to her mother's grave, kneeling before the hazel tree and bursting into tears. Hearing Ella's cries, a beautiful white dove flew above the hazel tree and perched on one of its branches. In a matter of seconds, the dove began to radiate. As the bright glow diminished, there stood an ethereal woman in the dove's place. She was unlike any human, a glowing feathery pair of ivory wings sprouting from her back like an angel's. Her hair mirrored the rarest of gold and she wore a tulle, layered gown made of fluffy clouds. In her hand, she held a long magic wand. Ella couldn't resist the wavering thought that the woman's beauty resembled that of her late mother's, but that seemed like too far of a stretch, didn't it? "Oh my dear Ella, why do you weep?" the woman spoke, her voice sweeter than honey. "Who are you, beautiful goddess?" Ella asked, choking back sobs. "Why, I am your fairy godmother of course! I shall grant whatever wish your heart desires until midnight. Now, please tell my dear, what will stop those tears?" What should Ella wish for?

+10 EXP. A "bibbidi-bobbidi-boo!" later, Ella's torn pink dress was replaced with a gorgeous shimmering ballgown the shade of iridescent sapphires. A pair of sparkling glass slippers slid on to her feet. Ella was overjoyed, twirling around in one spot to watch each sequin of her gown twinkle like the stars lighting up the night sky. "Oh, thank you so much, dear Fairy Godmother!" Ella cried. "You're very welcome, my dear! Now just remember, when the clock strikes midnight my magic will wear off!" Ella nodded and began her lengthy walk to the palace. In combination with the great distance, her glass slippers made it hard for her to get far. She never made it. Unfortunately, since Ella was unable to reach the royal ball before it ended, it was instead Drizella who captured the eye of Prince Charming. He was instantly enamoured by her beauty, and much like Ella's father, was fooled by good looks rather than appreciating good heart and fell for the wrong woman.

+10 EXP. "Ahh, may I borrow this pumpkin, dear Ella?" Fairy Godmother asked. "Well, I don't see why not." And with a wave of her wand, Fairy Godmother transformed the ordinary pumpkin into an elegant ivory coach. "Wow, thank you Fairy Godmother, it's beautiful!" Ella marvelled, before pursing her lips into a thin line. "But how shall it move?" "Don't worry, this shan't hurt one bit." And with another wave of her wand, Ella's tiny mice friends were transformed into mighty stallions. She felt a wave of relief wash over her as they nuzzled into her hands affectionately, reassuring her that they were fine. "Now just remember, my dear, when the clock strikes midnight my magic will wear off!" Ella thanked Fairy Godmother once more before ascending into the coach as the stallions raced towards the palace at lightning speed. Yet, when Ella arrived at the palace, she couldn't help but feel ashamed as the royal guards eyed her skeptically. She halted as they moved in front of the entrance, blocking her path. "Excuse me-" Ella began before the guards crossed their halberds in front of her. "You are not to enter the King's palace," one snickered. "This is no place for the poor. You are unfit to be a princess." THE END.

They stared, mouths agape, whispering among themselves. "Who is that?" one lady asked in awe. "She must be a princess!" another remarked. Prince Charming, himself, was no exception to the crowd. He was completely unable to take his eyes off Ella as he quickly weaved through the vast crowd just to approach her. "Hello, Milady," he began, running an white opera gloved hand through his chestnut locks. "My name is Henri," he gracefully offers his left hand to Ella. "May I have this dance?" What should Ella do?

But how on earth was Ella going to refuse the prince of all people in front of everyone? "Excuse me," a warm voice started behind Ella. "The lady's already promised me a dance." "Oh, I am sorry, I did not realize. My mistake," Henri apologized, hurrying away. Ella turned around and came face-to-face with a devilishly handsome gentleman. "I'm sorry, I'm sure a stunning lady like yourself already had it handled. I just couldn't resist," he chuckled. "Did you perhaps just want to dance with me?" Ella asked. "Was it that obvious?" "Maybe just a little. But no, I must thank you. I know it is his ball and everything, but I am truthfully too intimidated right now to be dancing with the prince himself tonight." "Not too intimidated to dance with a lord though?" Ella's jaw dropped open. "I am so sorry! I didn't realize-" "Do not fret, sweetheart, I am not a lord of this kingdom. I am simply visiting. I am a friend of the King, you understand." "Oh, but you look so young!" The lord laughed and the two spent the rest of the evening chatting and dancing away. By midnight, Ella felt that she could trust the lord and revealed her secret. So when her ballgown reverted back to her original pink torn rags, the lord instantly shielded her from prying eyes and proposed. Ella happily accepted, believing him to be a gentleman. But of course he was not. That "lord" had not been a true one, but an imposter; a malicious con man wanting Ella as nothing but a "trophy wife." Similar to her old days, Ella returned to spending the rest of her days trapped in misery. THE END.

"I am just relieved that such a beautiful individual agreed to spare me a dance." "Please," Ella smiled. "It is my honour that you, Prince Henri, approached me of all the talented dancers in this ballroom." "Nonsense," Henri laughed. "The honour is all mine." And so, the young couple danced and continued to dance for hours on end. Neither of them could take their eyes off of each other for even a second. For Ella, it was nothing less of a dream come true. Other noblewomen have tried to steal a dance from the prince of course, including Ella's stepsisters who failed to recognize her, but Henri politely brushed them off, claiming no one but Ella as his dance partner. Alas, the clock kept ticking and was nearing midnight. But Ella did not want to stop dancing. What should Ella do?

"Beware! It is an evil witch!" a guard cried out. "The wicked wretch's trying to deceive our prince!" another howled. Before Henri could protest and rush to Ella's defence, the royal guards pulled them apart, five holding back the prince and five dragging Ella away. From there, she was imprisoned for eternity for her crimes of witchcraft and attempting to deceive royalty. THE END.

+10 EXP. "I am terribly sorry, Prince Henri. As much as I want to continue spending this night with you, I must be getting home." "I understand," Henri nodded solemnly. "Allow me to escort you home." But Ella feared what the prince would think of her after the magic spell wore off. With all the strength she could muster, she pulled away from his arms, shaking her head tearfully and fleeing at once. "Goodbye!" she cried. "Wait, Milady, I never even knew your name!" he called after her, racing closely behind. As much as Ella wanted to stop in her tracks right there and run back into Henri's arms, she knew she had to heed her fairy godmother's warning. So she descended down the staircase to the entrance of the palace, each step making her feet slip more than the last. That was when one of her glass slippers actually did slip off. But time was running out. Should Ella go back for her missing glass slipper?

+10 EXP. Heeding her fairy godmother's warning, Ella scurried away, leaving her left glass slipper behind. She hopped into her coach as the stallions returned her to the château. Merely seconds later, the coach transformed back into the ordinary pumpkin, the stallions to her mice friends, and her ballgown to her ripped pink gown. Only her right glass slipper remained to which she hid up in the attic. The Tremaine Family returned shortly after. "Did you see that Drizella, Maman?" Anastasia sobbed, uncontrollable tears streaking her flushed cheeks. "The prince didn't even look at me!" "He was much too occupied dancing with that stupid princess," Drizella snapped. "I've never even seen that woman before." But Lady Tremaine's eyes told a different story. Ella felt a chill run down her spine as her stepmother scanned her over, eyes lingering on her bare feet. "Take a mattress and sleep in the attic tonight, Ella," she stated, using her real name for the first time since her father's death. Her stepsisters exchanged puzzled looks as Ella hurried away. The next morning, the King had declared that his son would be travelling all across the land in search of the beautiful maiden he had danced with the night before. Realizing that she would see Henri once more, Ella grew ecstatic, only for Lady Tremaine to lock her up in the attic for his arrival. "I shan't have no kitchen maid embarrassing us!" she exclaimed. What should Ella do?

Ella patiently waited and waited for her Prince Charming to rescue her. When he finally arrived, though reluctant at first glance, he politely asked each stepsister to try on Ella's glass slipper. They had tried to squeeze and stuff each of their toes inside, but to no avail. The slipper was just too small. As Henri made his way to search upstairs, Lady Tremaine blocked his path, claiming it to be a mess. Unknowingly, he abandoned poor Ella, searching across France and failing to find any woman who fit the glass slipper. Heartbroken, he instantly cancelled his plans of the wedding, refusing to marry anyone other than the beautiful maiden he had danced with that fateful night. From that day on, life had reverted back to normal for Ella. She had returned to slaving away at household chores for her stepmother and stepsisters each day, never hearing a word from Henri or her fairy godmother ever again. It was almost as if it all never happened. THE END.

+50 EXP. Thanks to her animal friends who arrived immediately at her call, Ella was able to unlock the door to the attic and reunite with her prince. Despite her dishevelled rags and golden tresses covered in cinders, with a single glance, Henri was able to tell that Ella was indeed his dance partner from last night at the ball. "It is you, Milady," he began. "You are my princess!" "Not so fast," Lady Tremaine interrupted, a scowl etched across her face. "Make her try on that ridiculous slipper, just as you did with my real beautiful daughters." Henri smiled. "May I?" he asked, not truly believing her words and more so to prove a point. Ella nodded as Henri carefully slipped the glass slipper onto Ella's left foot, sliding it on with ease. It was a perfect fit! "She is my true bride!" Henri declared. Ella's stepmother and stepsisters faces grew pale with anger while Henri led her to his chariot where they returned to his palace. The wedding took place the very next day where all of France rejoiced to celebrate the bridal couple. They lived happily ever after… THE END.
